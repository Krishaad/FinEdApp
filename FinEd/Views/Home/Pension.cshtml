    Explanation:
    Layout: The Layout directive points to a shared layout file (usually _Layout.cshtml) where the common structure of the site (like header, footer, and navigation) is defined.

    Content Sections: The page is divided into sections such as pension summary, types of pensions, benefits, contributions, planning, and FAQ.

    Styling: A basic style block is included to give some structure and styling to the content.

    Usage:
    Save this code as a .cshtml file within your Views folder in an ASP.NET MVC project, such as Views/Pensions/Index.cshtml.
    Ensure that your controller returns this view for it to be displayed.
    This template can be modified and expanded as needed to fit the specific requirements of your project.
